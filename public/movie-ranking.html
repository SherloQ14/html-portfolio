<h1>Best Movies According to Me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spiderman 2 (2004)</h3>
<p>
    Spiderman 2 is my all-time favorite movie. It captures the reality of superheroes. Superheroes are not just people with super powers and can do anything in the world, they are humans too. And this movie captures it. It is a story of the life of being a superhero who is just a regular human.

<h3>How to Train Your Dragon</h3>
<p>This movie captures my childhood. I love this movie since I was a child and up until this movie ended until I was a young man. My father made us watch this movie for the first time. It brings nostalgia when watching it. Remembering how easier times was back then when I was a child</p>
<h3>Hero</h3>
<p>I love this movie. It is an action movie and animated at the same time. This movie captures my nostaliga moments as well.</p>
